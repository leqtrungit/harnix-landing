# Harnix landing page

Implementation of `Harnix Landing.dc.html` from the Claude Design handoff, built
as a Next.js App Router site with Tailwind v4.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build && npm run start
npm run typecheck
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` to set the site URL, milestone, demo status
and lead destination.

## Layout

| Path | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| `app/layout.tsx` | Fonts, metadata, and the pre-paint theme/language bootstrap |
| `app/page.tsx` | Section order |
| `app/globals.css` | Design tokens (dark + light), keyframes, base styles |
| `app/opengraph-image.tsx` | The 1200×630 social card, rendered from the design's template |
| `app/icon.tsx` | Favicon drawn from the mark |
| `app/api/*` | `posts`, `partner`, `waitlist` route handlers |
| `components/sections/*` | One file per section of the page |
| `lib/copy.ts` | All copy — VI is the source of truth, EN is a partial overlay |
| `lib/config.ts` | The knobs the design exposed as editable props |
| `content/posts.ts` | Blog rows served by `/api/posts` |
| `design/` | The original handoff bundle: prototypes, transcripts, brief |

## Decisions worth knowing

**Tokens are verbatim.** Every colour, radius, type size and spacing value comes
from the design file, including the odd ones (`14.5px`, `11.5px`, `#70707a`).
They live as CSS custom properties in `app/globals.css` and are exposed to
Tailwind through `@theme inline`, so `bg-surface2` and `text-text3` resolve to
the same variables the light theme overrides. Verified against the prototype:
`#0c0c0d` body, `56px/1.04/-0.03em` h1, `1160px` container with `24px` gutters,
`12px` card radius on `#141416` / `#26262a`, mono at `11.5px/1.75`.

**Dark is the default**, switched only by explicit choice — the OS
`prefers-color-scheme` is deliberately not consulted, matching the design. The
choice is stored in `localStorage` and applied by an inline script before first
paint, so there is no flash. (To respect the OS setting instead, change the
`bootstrap` string in `app/layout.tsx`.)

**English covers nav and hero only**, per §9.1 of the brief. Every other key
falls back to Vietnamese through `translate()` — that is the design's behaviour,
not a gap.

**The prototype chrome is gone.** The amber state switcher was a design-review
tool, so the states it faked are now real:

- the blog fetches `/api/posts` and renders loading / loaded / empty / error on
  its own, with a working retry;
- both forms validate client-side and POST for real, showing sending, success
  and server-error states from the response;
- the demo's coming-soon / ready split is `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_STATUS`.

**Leads have no CRM yet.** `lib/leads.ts` POSTs each submission to
`LEADS_WEBHOOK_URL` if set, and otherwise logs it server-side while still
returning success. Swap that one function for the real integration.

**Accessibility.** The tabs, accordion, segmented controls and form errors carry
real ARIA (`role="tablist"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-invalid` +
`aria-describedby`), there is a skip link, the wordmark's dotless `ı` is hidden
from assistive tech behind an `sr-only` "Harnix", and `prefers-reduced-motion`
disables the pulse, shimmer and spinner. Checked for horizontal overflow at 390,
768 and 1440px.

**SEO lives in the route conventions.** `app/robots.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts` and
`app/manifest.ts` generate `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` and the web manifest;
`/api` is disallowed, and the sitemap lists only `/` because that is the only
route that exists. `components/structured-data.tsx` emits one JSON-LD graph —
Organization, WebSite, FAQPage — built from `lib/copy.ts` and `lib/config.ts`,
so editing a FAQ entry updates the markup with it. The blog rows are passed to
the section from the server (`<Blog initialPosts={posts} />`) so the titles and
excerpts are in the first HTML response rather than behind a client fetch.

## Still outstanding

- **Screenshots.** The hero console frame and the demo poster are DOM
  recreations, as they were in the prototype. Swap in real captures.
- **`/blog` routes.** `content/posts.ts` points at `/blog/<slug>`, and the blog
  section and footer both link to `/blog`; those pages are not part of the
  landing page and do not exist yet, so every one of those links is a 404 that
  crawlers will follow. Until they ship this is the largest remaining SEO
  liability on the page — either build the routes (then add them to
  `app/sitemap.ts`, which has the snippet commented in) or drop the links.
- **Demo chapter timings.** `chapters[].at` in `lib/copy.ts` is placeholder
  spacing; replace with real marks when the video is cut. They only surface once
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_STATUS=ready`.
- **Outlined-wordmark SVG.** Still needs real font outlines; the lockups here are
  live text.
- **Integration snippets** in the developer section are illustrative, and the
  section says so. The API contract is not settled.
